An overly complicated footstep sound enhancement mod for Minecraft.

Originally authored by Hurricaaane, now updated past Minecraft 1.15.2 by Sollace.

## Sound Packs

Presence Footsteps is **fully customisable** with resource packs. The mod by default includes a pack with its own sounds
and material mappings for the vanilla blocks, however if you don't like those sounds or want to use your own, this pack can be turned off
or used together with packs from the community.

Note that you need **at least one** sounds pack enabled for the mod to function.

## Mod Support

Presence Footsteps will attempt to figure out the sounds of modded blocks by looking at the vanilla material/sound types they use.
If your mod is using very unique sounds though, you can add mappings to your mod to directly control what sounds presence footsteps uses for your block by
following the [guide on our wiki](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators)
